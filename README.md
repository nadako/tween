This repo currently contains my experiments related to tweening and easing.

Maybe one day I'll make yet another tweening library for Haxe,
because for my projects I really want something really minimal
and easy to integrate with any code base.

If you're looking for a ready-to-use tweening engine, I would recommend this one: https://github.com/furusystems/Delta.
It's quite small, yet fully featured.
